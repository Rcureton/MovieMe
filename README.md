# MovieMe

##Overview:
 MovieMe features The Movie DB's API. I learned to use Retrofit for this specific project. The app displays a list of movies in a CustomAdapter sorted by Popularity, Top Rated, Upcoming, and Now Playing. Also added a search activity where users can search for a specific movie.
